      <h1>Road Crashes in Victoria (June 2015 - July 2020)</h1>
      <p>Feeling safe is a basic human right. This visualisation presents information regarding road crashes in Victoria from June 2015 - July 2020.
        It aims to enhence our understanding of road safety in Victoria, to reduce the pain and suffereing caused by road crashes. The data presented
        has been collected by VicRoads, an organisation that developes and manages the roads in Victoria.</p>

      <p>As show in the map above, there is a higher incidence of road crashes in the metropolitan regions of Victoria. The density of red circles is also high
        in Bendigo, Ballarat, Latrobe and Shepparton. This may mean that the roads in these areas are more dangerous, however, this phenomenon is most likely due to the higher population
        density living in these areas. As humans, it is inevitable that accidents happen, hence, a positive correlation between the number of people and the number 
        of accidents is reasonable.</p>

      <p>The map above shows the prelevance of fatalities on the roads of Victoria. Similar to the map titled 'Number of injuries and fatalities due to road crashes',
        there is a higher incidence of road fatalities in metropolitan regions and in Bedigo, Ballarat, Latrobe and Shepparton. This supports the idea that a higher 
        number of road crashes occur in more populated regions.</p>

      <h2>Types of road crashes</h2>
      <div id="type_of_crash" class="vis-container"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="pure-u-1-2">
      <p>But what causes these road crashes in Victoria? The pie chart on the right shows the main types of road crashes. The most prominent being collision with 
      vehicle. As seen from the pie chart, most of these road crashes are caused by human error, colliding with something or someone. While driving on public roads, 
      it is not only essential to follow the road rules, but also to watch out for others who may be breaking rules. Accidents happen. Other people may not be consciously 
      trying to do the wrong thing, but it is inevitable that people make mistakes. As we have all learnt while learning to drive, there are blind spots that the driver 
      is unable to see. Hence, it is essential to be alert and pay attention to those around you.</p>
    </div>
  </div>  
  <div class="pure-g">
    <div class="pure-u-1-2">
      <p>By common sense, most of us may assume that driving at night is more risky and dangerous compared to driving during the day. It may feel more dangerous, 
      especially for those individuals that are still learning. However, as seen from the bar graph on the right, there is a smaller number of accidents in the dark, 
      even if the street lights are off. This bar graph is extremely misleading. As most drivers are aware, good lighting is essential for drivers to be aware of 
      their surroundings and staying safe. This misleading graph is most likely due to more drivers driving during the day, causing an increased number of accidents. 
      Anyone that has driven at night would know that there are generally a lot less people on the road druing the night. It may even be true that here is a higher
      chance of accidents occuring during the night where there is bad lighting. However, more research and data should be collected on this matter.</p>

    <div class="pure-u-1-2">
      <h2>Number of injuries and fatalities at different light conditions</h2>
      <div id="light_condition" class="vis-container"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="pure-g">
    <div class="pure-u-1-2">
      <h2>Number of injuries and fatalities on different days of the week</h2>
      <div id="days_of_week" class="vis-container"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="pure-u-1-2">
      <p>There isn't a huge difference between the number of injuries and fatalities on different days of the week, but there is a difference between weekdays and 
      weekends. This could be due to more people driving to work during weekdays, but it could also be due to people driving more recklessly during the week to arrive
      at work on time, or being too tired after work to drive home safely. As seen from the bar chart to the left and the bar chart above, alcohol related accidents are
      only a very small proportion of the accidents, however, there is a slight increase on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. On these days, especially during the night
      people should be more aware of other drivers, as there are more likely to be drunk drivers on the road.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="pure-u-1-1">
      <p>The lesson to be learnt, is to be especailly aware of your surroundings when you are driving. It is inevitable that mistakes and accidents will happen, but
      being aware could help reduce the odds. Road crashes are more commonly seen in highly populated metropolitan regions and cities and the most common type of 
      accident is collision with another vehicle. Hence, it is important to be aware of the other vehicles around you. Alcohol related accidents are more prominent
      on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays and after dark, which every driver should be aware of. Hopefully, as more and more people practice safe driving, the number of 
      accidents and fatalities on our roads can also reduce.</p>
